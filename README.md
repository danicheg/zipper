## Zipper — an implementation of Huet’s Zipper

A Zipper is a tool that allows to navigate and modify immutable recursive data structures.
This implementation is inspired by
[the original paper by Huet](https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/edu/seminare/2005/advanced-fp/docs/huet-zipper.pdf),
as well as the [Argonaut’s JSON Zipper](http://argonaut.io/doc/zipper/).

See https://stanch.github.io/zipper for more details.
